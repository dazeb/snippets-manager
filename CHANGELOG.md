- Updated UI text, icons, and terminology

**New Features:**
- **Prompt Management**: Store and organize AI prompts, templates, and reusable content
- **Enhanced UI**: Prompts now use ü§ñ emoji and prompt-specific terminology
- **Same Functionality**: All existing features (search, tags, projects, spaces) work with prompts

**Technical Changes:**

## [2025-01-06] - Build Optimization & Performance

### ‚ö° **Build Performance Optimization**

**Problem Solved:**
- ‚ùå Large bundle chunks (>1000 kB) causing slow initial load times
- ‚ùå Monolithic JavaScript bundles
- ‚ùå Syntax highlighting loading all languages upfront

**Optimizations Implemented:**

**üîß Advanced Code Splitting:**
- **React Core**: 8.25 kB (3.13 kB gzipped) - Essential React functionality
- **React DOM**: 171.98 kB (54.12 kB gzipped) - DOM rendering separated
- **Convex Vendor**: 67.16 kB (18.48 kB gzipped) - Database client isolated
- **Radix UI**: 1.79 kB (0.84 kB gzipped) - UI primitives
- **Styling Utils**: 26.60 kB (8.04 kB gzipped) - Tailwind utilities
- **Large Components**: 21.35 kB (4.93 kB gzipped) - Form components
- **Syntax Highlighting**: 1,734.55 kB (538.77 kB gzipped) - Isolated and lazy-loaded

**üöÄ Dynamic Imports:**
- **Lazy Components**: Form components load only when needed
- **Route-Level Splitting**: Space selector and content manager separated
- **Component Preloading**: Smart preloading based on user interactions
- **Icon Picker**: Lazy-loaded with 100+ icons

**‚öôÔ∏è Build Configuration:**
- **Manual Chunking**: Optimized vendor splitting by functionality
- **Terser Minification**: Advanced compression with console removal
- **Chunk Size Limit**: Increased to 1.5MB for syntax highlighting
- **Source Maps**: Disabled for production builds

**üìà Performance Results:**
- **Initial Bundle**: Reduced from monolithic to ~50kB core
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load on-demand
- **Gzip Compression**: Average 70% size reduction
- **Load Time**: Significantly faster initial page load

## [2025-01-06] - Deployment Clarification & Simplification

### üìã **Deployment Architecture Clarification**

**Important:** This application **does NOT need nginx** or complex server setup!

2. **Netlify** (Great for SPAs) - `netlify.toml` included
3. **GitHub Pages** (Free for public repos)
4. **Cloudflare Pages** (Global CDN)

**‚ùå What You DON'T Need:**
- nginx or Apache web servers
- Express.js or Node.js servers
