### ‚ö° **Build Performance Optimization**

**Problem Solved:**
- ‚ùå Large bundle chunks (>1000 kB) causing slow initial load times
- ‚ùå Monolithic JavaScript bundles
- ‚ùå Syntax highlighting loading all languages upfront

**Optimizations Implemented:**

**üîß Advanced Code Splitting:**

## [2025-01-06] - Deployment Clarification & Simplification

### üìã **Deployment Architecture Clarification**

**Important:** This application **does NOT need nginx** or complex server setup!

**Why No Server Needed:**
- **Frontend**: React SPA (static files only)
- **Backend**: Convex (fully serverless)
- **Database**: Convex (managed cloud)
- **Authentication**: Convex Auth (handled)
- **API**: Convex functions (serverless)

**‚úÖ Recommended Deployment Options:**
1. **Vercel** (Perfect for React + Convex) - `vercel.json` included
2. **Netlify** (Great for SPAs) - `netlify.toml` included
3. **GitHub Pages** (Free for public repos)
4. **Cloudflare Pages** (Global CDN)

**‚ùå What You DON'T Need:**
- nginx or Apache web servers
- Express.js or Node.js servers
- Complex Docker setups
- Load balancers
- Database servers
- Authentication servers

**üîß Changes Made:**
- **Updated Dockerfile**: Removed nginx, simplified to static server
- **Added vercel.json**: Zero-config Vercel deployment
- **Added netlify.toml**: Optimized Netlify configuration

### üêõ **Fixed: Module Script MIME Type Error**

**Problem:** `Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/octet-stream"`

**Root Cause:** Web servers serving JavaScript files with incorrect MIME type instead of `text/javascript`

**‚úÖ Solutions Implemented:**

- **Module Type**: `type="module"` in HTML script tags
- **Cross-Origin**: Proper `crossorigin` attributes for module preloading

## [2025-01-06] - Environment Variable Configuration Fix

### üêõ **Fixed: Convex Deployment Secret Error**

**Problem:** `Environment Variable "CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT" references Secret "convex_deployment", which does not exist`

**Root Cause:** Vercel configuration referencing non-existent secret instead of environment variable

**‚úÖ Solutions Implemented:**

**üîß Configuration Updates:**
- **Removed Secret Reference**: Eliminated `@convex_deployment` from `vercel.json`
- **Simplified Environment Setup**: Use standard environment variables instead of secrets
- **Clear Variable Naming**: `VITE_CONVEX_URL` for production, `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` for development

**üìÅ Files Added/Updated:**

- **`.env.example`**: Updated with clear variable naming and usage instructions
- **`vercel.json`**: Removed secret references, simplified configuration
- **`package.json`**: Added production deployment scripts

**üöÄ Deployment Process:**
1. **Development**: `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` automatically set by `convex dev`
2. **Production**: `VITE_CONVEX_URL` manually set in hosting platform
3. **Build Scripts**: Separate commands for dev and production deployment

**üìã Platform-Specific Instructions:**
- **Vercel**: Set `VITE_CONVEX_URL` in dashboard environment variables
- **Netlify**: Set `VITE_CONVEX_URL` in site settings
- **Docker**: Use environment variable injection
